Changelog for Writer2LaTeX version 1.4 -> 1.6

---------- version 1.5.2 ----------

Items marked with * are work in progress

[all] Using the filters from the command line with soffice --headless --convert-to is now documented in the user manual

[all] Filter API change: The filters now accepts the FilterOptions property as an alternative to FilterData.
  This property accepts a comma separated string of option=value items. In particular this allows to pass option
  from the command line (soffice --headless --convert-to).

[all] API change: The interface OutputFile now defines an additional method containsMath() which returns true if the file
  contains mathematical formulas (only implemented for XHTML, currently always returns true for LaTeX)

[w2x] The template page in the configuration now displays an error message if the template is not well-formed XML.

[w2x] Added toolbar configuration dialog: Select XHTML and EPUB export format and behavior after export (do nothing,
  display in default viewer or display with custom application) 
  
[w2x] New option include_ncx to include a NCX file even if the export format is EPUB 3 

[w2x] Added EPUB 3 as export format and changed default export format for the toolbar to EPUB 3

[all] Implementation detail: Moved descriptions to a separate folder within the extensions

[all] The position of message boxes has changed from (0,0) to (200,100)

[w2l] Implementation detail: The dialog library W4LDialogs is now merged into W2LDialogs2. This avoids conflicts with
  the old Writer4LaTeX extension if this happens to be installed.

[all] Fixed typo in export dialogs: The text on the help button was in danish.

[w2x] New boolean option embed_img (default false). If set to true, the binary contents of img elements are included
  directly on the src attribute as base64.
  
[w2l] The bibliography configuration is slightly modified: The options to convert Zotero or JabRef citations are now
  only available if the option to use external BibTeX files is selected 

[w2l] Added new BibTeX dialog to insert a bibliographic reference to a BibTeX file. The BibTeX files are located as
  defined in the configuration, and the reference is inserted as an ordinary reference mark.

[w2l] Various improvements to the log viewer dialog: Reduced height to better accommodate small screen resolutions.
  Added checkbox to filter the LaTeX log to display only errors. Added help page and long tips.

[w2x] Changed default export format for toolbar from XHTML+MathML to HTML5

[w2l] *Added new option font to load font packages. It accepts a large number of standard font packages such as
  cmbright or fourier. Only packages with math support are included. Unknown packages defaults to Computer Modern.
  The font option is currently not available for the backend xetex.
  In the user interface, this option can be found in the export dialog. To make room for this, the BibTeX
  settings no longer has a heading in the dialog.

[w2l] Bugfix: Include w2lconfig.oxt in the distribution (was missing in 1.5.1)

---------- version 1.5.1 ----------

[w2l] Implementation detail: Updated to version 20140107 of the JSON library org.json.* from JSON.org.
  Now based on prebuilt jar rather than directly on the source.

[w2l] Merged the extension Writer4LaTeX into Writer2LaTeX, where it now appears as "the Writer2LaTeX toolbar".
  Replaced menu with a toolbar with four buttons: Insert BibTeX citation (not yet implemented), publish to LaTeX,
  view log files and edit custom format. (Publishing without showing the dialog is currently removed.)
  Using the toolbar bypasses the filter logic, which gives a significant performance gain for large documents.
  The remaining parts of Writer4LaTeX (the article template, configuration and help file) has been renamed
  to "Writer2LaTeX configurations" (short w2lconfig).

[all] Implementation detail: Replaced Robert Harder's base 64 class with javax.xml.bind.DatatypeConverter

[w2x] Style maps for paragraphs and headings now support the attributes before and after. These define fixed texts
  to add before/after the content. (This is similar to the pseudo-elements ::before and ::after in CSS.)

[w2x] Added toolbar with four buttons: Publish directly to XHTML, publish directly to EPUB, edit EPUB metadata
  and edit custom configuration. Publishing directly implies that the file picker is not displayed. Instead
  the document will be exported to the same directory as the currently open document and with the same name.
  The EPUB buttons are only visible in Writer, the other buttons are also visible in Calc.
  This feature bypasses the filter logic, which gives a significant performance gain for large documents.

[all] Filter: Refactored filter code, the actual conversion has been separated from the XExportFilter implementation
