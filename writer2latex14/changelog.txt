Changelog for Writer2LaTeX version 1.2 -> 1.4

---------- version 1.4 final ----------

[all] The help button is now labeled Help in all export dialogs 

[w2x] Bugfix: No longer include xmlns attribute on math nodes in HTML5 export

[w2l] Workaround for an oddity seen in AOO 4.1 and LO 4.0: For SVG images the alternative PNG representation is stored
  before the SVG image in the document. Now the alternative image is preferred if it can be converted to the default
  vector format of the conversion.

[w2x] Bugfix: The option pages for editing the custom style are now also visible in Calc

[w2l] Bugfix: In the export dialog, the LaTeX format is now persistent, also for custom formats

[w2x] Bugfix: The date dialog used by the EPUB Metadata dialog now has a title

[w2x] Bugfix: The date field in the EPUB Metadata dialog did not work in LO 4.1 and newer. This was due to an API
  change in LO (long replaced by com.sun.star.util.Date), and is now fixed.

---------- version 1.4 beta ----------

[w4l] Zotero BibTeX exporter is updated to the latest version

[all] Build file is now set up to cross compile for java 6

[w2x] If the export dialogs are loaded with a setting for scaling or column_scaling of 1% or less, the value
  is reset to 100%. This is a workaround for an obscure bug in the extension manager, which in some cases sets
  the value to 1% if the export is used right after installation.

[w2x] Bugfix: The help button on the EPUB export dialog now works

[w2x] Bugfix: Avoid null pointer exception in HTML5 export if embed_svg is true and an image is used more than once

[all] An image that is used more than once in the source document is now only exported once. This was already the
  case for the package format (since 1.3.2), but now also for flat XML.

[w2x] The The option inline_svg has been renamed (again) to embed_svg, and the default is changed to false

[w2x] The experimental option zen_hack has been removed

[w2x] For templates it is no longer required that the footer, header and panel are contained in a div element.
  This allows for HTML5 code like <header><nav id="header">...</nav></header>. The default header and footer
  are now created with header+nav and footer+nav elements if the target format is HTML5.

---------- version 1.3.2 alpha ----------

[w2l] Two or more span elements in a row which generates identical formatting in LaTeX are now merged.
  This avoids constructs like \textbf{this is }\textbf{bold}.

[w2l] Optimization: The SimpleDomBuilder now merges text nodes

[w2l] Replace usage of StringBuffer with StringBuilder everywhere (marginal optimization)

[w2l] The standard configurations pdfprint.xml and pdfscreen.xml no longer requires ooomath.sty

[w2l] A bookmark in a heading no longer results in an optional argument to \section commands 
 
[w2l] New option display_hidden_text (default false) to toggle whether or not hidden text should be included in
  the export. In the export filter, this option can be toggled in the export options dialog.

[w2l] Bugfix (StarMath conversion): The five colors red, green, blue, magenta and yellow is now exported to the
  correct dark colors rather than the previous bright colors (the colors white, black and yellow are unchanged)

[w2x] If a border has a width which is equivalent to less that 1px, it is now exported with the width 1px.
  This fixes an issue with some browsers, that would render the border invisible.

[w2x] Two or more span elements in a row with identical attributes are now merged

[all] Filters: Appended [Writer2LaTeX] or [Writer2xhtml] to all filter UI names to make them more visible 

[w2l] Bugfix: Avoid null pointer exception caused by list styles in some cases

[w2x] Bugfix: EPUB export filter works again (was broken in 1.3.1)

[w2x] Bugfix: Text boxes are no longer lost if within a paragraph

[w2x] SVG support in HTML5 is now finished: Images in SVG format are kept in the original format.
  Other vector images are converted to SVG (filter only). This only works with recent versions of the office
  (LO 4.2 and AOO 4.1 are known to work). The option use_svg has been renamed to inline_svg. If set to
  true (default) inline SVG is used, if set to false, external SVG-files (img-elements) are used.
  In the UI, this setting can be found on the options page Writer2xhtml - Content.

[all] If an image image cannot be converted to an acceptable format, the optional alternative image will now be tried

[all] Bugfix: Avoid null pointer exception if a table has no defined table width

[w2l] Bugfix (StarMath conversion): Protect the character [ after \\ in gather and matrix environments

[w2l] Bugfix: Protect the character [ after \\ in tables

[w2l] Bugfix (StarMath conversion): Usage of \multiscripts and \mathoverstrike now loads the required calc.sty

[w2l] Bugfix (StarMath conversion): Do not create display equations in table cells 

[w2l] Bugfix (StarMath conversion): Set the counter MaxMatrixCols if there are matrices with more than 10 columns
 
[w2l] Bugfix (StarMath conversion): Add braces if the argument to a command is a space, e.g. \text{ }

[all] Refactored and optimized memory usage of image conversion

[all] Refactored and rearranged some code; in particular the last remaining bits of the old xmerge framework has been removed

[all] Optimized reading of package format: The settings.xml files are not parsed and the unused parts of the ZIP file are disposed

---------- version 1.3.1 alpha ----------

[w2x] Starting with version 4.2, LibreOffice exports display="math" on display equations. This attribute is now
  removed if a display equation is used inline in the source document.

[w2x] Support for the obsolete output format XHTML+MahtML+XSL has been removed (replaced by MathJax). As a consequence
  the option xslt_path has been removed. Also the vacant spot in the export dialog is now used for the option use_mathjax
  (only active for XHTML+MathML and HTML5) 

[all] Added support for TexMaths equations in LaTeX, XHTML+MathML and HTML5 (the last two only if use_mathjax=true)

[all] The command line application now gives an explanation if the source file is not in ODF format

[all] Bugfix: Fixed typo that caused writer2latex.office.MIMETypes.getMagicMIMEType() to fail in some cases 

[w2x] The option ignore_table_dimensions has been replaced by a new option table_size with values none (do not export table
  dimensions), relative (always use relative width) and auto (use the formatting of the source document):
  If set to true, all tables are exported with relative width, even if they have an absolute width in the source document

[w2x] New boolean option use_mathjax (default false): If set to true and export format is XHTML+MATHML or HTML5,
  documents will load the MathJax JavaScript library for rendering of formulas (otherwise the document will rely
  on native MathML support in the browser)

[w2x] New boolean option use_svg (default false): If set to true and export format is HTML5, vector graphics are exported as
  inline SVG, if possible

[w2x] Added support for HTML5 as export type (the ConverterFactory understands the pseudo-MIME type text/html5).
  The converter creates polyglot HTML5 documents, i.e. documents will be conforming to HTML5 as well as XML standards.

[all] Optimized the parsing of the source document saving some time and space (several intermediate steps and large byte arrays
  are now avoided)

[all] API change: The converters can now convert directly from a DOM tree

[all] Removed unused code in writer2latex.xmerge

[w2x] Moved localized strings to .properties files
